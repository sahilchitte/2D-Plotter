# 2D-Plotter
Here i have 2 dimensional X-Y plotter design with Driver codes for its motors(X-Y).

The X-Y plotter is designed to record and plot two dimensional data on a rectangular coordinate system. The material selection of the mechanism was made considering the cost and wide range of applications such as servo motor. Servo motor can be differentiated through the cost, peak torque capability, speed range to compromise the standard and application of the system. The XY gantry model consisting of two motors for Y control with another motor sliding the gantry in the X direction. The design uses two parallel rails for Y-motion with a bar spanning across the rails which holds the end effectors of the system.
In the other hand, the accuracy of plotting is the main issue to be concerned on the fabrication of X-Y plotter. Few papers have been devoted to plotters in term of their adjustment methods on the accuracy and movement of plotter.
The X-Y plotter system is a more simplified system compared to the CNC machines since CNC machines run on 3 axis direction and the programming is more complicated. the coding for the CNC system which is the G-Code programming can be modified and simplified to use with the 2 axis coding movement. G-Code is the generic name for a control language for Reprap machines.In this X-Y plotter system, G-Code is employed by the programmer to specify the coordinates of the point to be moved and giving the vector to the surface at that point. For the core system, Arduino system is familiar and mainly used in most of the electronic components because of is compatibility of the system with the hardware.
 Plotters differ from Inkjet and Laser printers in that a plotter draws a continuous line, much like a pen on paper, while inkjet and laser printers use a very fine matrix of dots to form images, such that while a line may appear continuous to the naked eye, it in fact is a discrete set of points.

Here are some of Images of plotter
